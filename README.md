# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuspell/neuspell; cd neuspell
pip install -e .
```

To install extra requirements,

```bash
pip install -r extras-requirements.txt
```

or individually as:

```bash
pip install -e .[elmo]
pip install -e .[spacy]
```

NOTE: For _zsh_, use ".[elmo]" and ".[spacy]" instead

Additionally, ```spacy models``` can be downloaded as:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Then, download pretrained models of `neuspell`
following [Download Checkpoints](#Download-Checkpoints)

Here is a quick-start code snippet (command line usage) to use a checker model.
See [test_neuspell_correctors.py](./tests/test_neuspell_correctors.py) for more usage patterns.

```python
import neuspell
from neuspell import available_checkers, BertChecker

""" see available checkers """
print(f"available checkers: {neuspell.available_checkers()}")
# → available checkers: ['BertsclstmChecker', 'CnnlstmChecker', 'NestedlstmChecker', 'SclstmChecker', 'SclstmbertChecker', 'BertChecker', 'SclstmelmoChecker', 'ElmosclstmChecker']

""" select spell checkers & load """
checker = BertChecker()
checker.from_pretrained()

""" spell correction """
checker.correct("I luk foward to receving your reply")
# → "I look forward to receiving your reply"
checker.correct_strings(["I luk foward to receving your reply", ])
# → ["I look forward to receiving your reply"]
checker.correct_from_file(src="noisy_texts.txt")
# → "Found 450 mistakes in 322 lines, total_lines=350"

""" evaluation of models """
checker.evaluate(clean_file="bea60k.txt", corrupt_file="bea60k.noise.txt")
# → data size: 63044
# → total inference time for this data is: 998.13 secs
# → total token count: 1032061
# → confusion table: corr2corr:940937, corr2incorr:21060,
#                    incorr2corr:55889, incorr2incorr:14175
# → accuracy is 96.58%
# → word correction rate is 79.76%
```

Alternatively, once can also select and load a spell checker differently as follows:

```python
from neuspell import SclstmChecker

checker = SclstmChecker()
checker = checker.add_("bert", at="input")  # "elmo" or "bert", "input" or "output"
checker.from_pretrained()
```

This feature of adding ELMO or BERT model is currently supported for selected models.
See [List of neural models in the toolkit](#List-of-neural-models-in-the-toolkit) for details.

If interested, follow [Additional Requirements](#Additional-requirements) for installing non-neural
spell checkers- ```Aspell``` and ```Jamspell```.

### Installation through pip

```bash
pip install neuspell
```

In v1.0, `allennlp` library is not automatically installed which is used for models containing ELMO.
Hence, to utilize those checkers, do a source install as
in [Installation & Quick Start](#Installation)

# Toolkit

### Introduction

NeuSpell is an open-source toolkit for context sensitive spelling correction in English. This
toolkit comprises of 10 spell checkers, with evaluations on naturally occurring mis-spellings from
multiple (publicly available) sources. To make neural models for spell checking context dependent, (
i) we train neural models using spelling errors in context, synthetically constructed by reverse
engineering isolated mis-spellings; and  (ii) use richer representations of the context.This toolkit
enables NLP practitioners to use our proposed and existing spelling correction systems, both via a
simple unified command line, as well as a web interface. Among many potential applications, we
demonstrate the utility of our spell-checkers in combating adversarial misspellings.

```python
import neuspell

neuspell.seq_modeling.download_pretrained_model("subwordbert-probwordnoise")
```

Alternatively, download all Neuspell neural models by running the following (available in versions
after v1.0):

```python
import neuspell

neuspell.seq_modeling.download_pretrained_model("_all_")
```

Alternatively,

### Datasets

We curate several synthetic and natural datasets for training/evaluating neuspell models. For full
details, check our [paper](#Citation). Run the following to download all the datasets.

```
cd data/traintest
python download_datafiles.py 
```

See ```data/traintest/README.md``` for more details.

Train files are dubbed with names ```.random```, ```.word```, ```.prob```, ```.probword``` for
different noising startegies used to create them. For each strategy (
see [Synthetic data creation](#Synthetic-data-creation)), we noise ∼20% of the tokens in the clean
corpus. We use 1.6 Million sentences from
the [```One billion word benchmark```](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3005) dataset as our clean corpus.

### Demo Setup

In order to setup a demo, follow these steps:

- Do [Installation](#Installation) and then install flask requirements
  as  ```pip install -e ".[flask]"```
- Download [checkpoints](#Pretrained-models) (__Note__: If you wish to use only one of the neural
  checkers, you need to manually disable others in the imports
  of [./scripts/flask-server/app.py](./scripts/flask-server/app.py))
- Start a flask server in folder [./scripts/flask-server](./scripts/flask-server) by
  running `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python app.py`
  (on GPU) or `python app.py` (on CPU)

### Synthetic data creation

##### English

This toolkit offers 3 kinds of noising strategies (identfied from existing literature) to generate
synthetic parallel training data to train neural models for spell correction. The strategies include
a simple lookup based noisy spelling replacement (`en-word-replacement-noise`), a character level
noise induction such as swapping/deleting/adding/replacing characters (`en-char-replacement-noise`),
and a confusion matrix based probabilistic character replacement driven by mistakes patterns in a
large corpus of spelling mistakes (`en-probchar-replacement-noise`). For full details about these
approaches, checkout our [paper](#Citation).

Following are the corresponding class mappings to utilize the above noise curations. As some
pre-built data files are used for some of the noisers, we also provide their approximate disk space.

| Folder                          | Class name                                | Disk space (approx.) |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `en-word-replacement-noise`     | `WordReplacementNoiser`                   | 2 MB                 |
| `en-char-replacement-noise`     | `CharacterReplacementNoiser`              | --                   |
| `en-probchar-replacement-noise` | `ProbabilisticCharacterReplacementNoiser` | 80 MB                |

Following is a snippet for using these noisers-

```python
from neuspell.noisers import WordReplacementNoiser

example_texts = [
    "This is an example sentence to demonstrate noising in the neuspell repository.",
    "Here is another such amazing example !!"
]

word_repl_noiser = WordReplacementNoiser(language="english")
word_repl_noiser.load_resources()
noise_texts = word_repl_noiser.noise(example_texts)
print(noise_texts)
```

# Finetuning on custom data and creating new models

### Finetuning on top of `neuspell` pretrained models

```python
from neuspell import BertChecker

checker = BertChecker()
checker.from_pretrained()
checker.finetune(clean_file="sample_clean.txt", corrupt_file="sample_corrupt.txt",
                 data_dir="default")
```

This feature is only available for `BertChecker` and `ElmosclstmChecker`.

### Training other Transformers/BERT-based models

We now support initializing a huggingface model and finetuning it on your custom data. Here is a
code snippet demonstrating that:

First mark your files containing clean and corrupt texts in a line-seperated format

```python
from neuspell.commons import DEFAULT_TRAINTEST_DATA_PATH

data_dir = DEFAULT_TRAINTEST_DATA_PATH
clean_file = "sample_clean.txt"
corrupt_file = "sample_corrupt.txt"
```

```python
from neuspell.seq_modeling.helpers import load_data, train_validation_split
from neuspell.seq_modeling.helpers import get_tokens
from neuspell import BertChecker

# Step-0: Load your train and test files, create a validation split
train_data = load_data(data_dir, clean_file, corrupt_file)
train_data, valid_data = train_validation_split(train_data, 0.8, seed=11690)

# Step-1: Create vocab file. This serves as the target vocab file and we use the defined model's default huggingface
# tokenizer to tokenize inputs appropriately.
vocab = get_tokens([i[0] for i in train_data], keep_simple=True, min_max_freq=(1, float("inf")),
                   topk=100000)

# # Step-2: Initialize a model
checker = BertChecker(device="cuda")
checker.from_huggingface(bert_pretrained_name_or_path="distilbert-base-cased", vocab=vocab)

# Step-3: Finetune the model on your dataset
checker.finetune(clean_file=clean_file, corrupt_file=corrupt_file, data_dir=data_dir)
```

You can further evaluate your model on a custom data as follows:

```python
from neuspell import BertChecker

checker = BertChecker()
checker.from_pretrained(
    bert_pretrained_name_or_path="distilbert-base-cased",
    ckpt_path=f"{data_dir}/new_models/distilbert-base-cased"  # "<folder where the model is saved>"
)
checker.evaluate(clean_file=clean_file, corrupt_file=corrupt_file, data_dir=data_dir)
```

### Multilingual Models

Following usage above, once can now seamlessly utilize multilingual models such
as `xlm-roberta-base`,
`bert-base-multilingual-cased` and `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased` on a non-English script.

# Potential applications for practitioners

Our toolkit comprises ten different models, and benchmarks them on naturally occurring misspellings from multiple sources. We find that many systems do not adequately leverage the context around the misspelt token. To remedy this, (i) we train neural models using spelling errors in context, synthetically constructed by reverse engineering isolated misspellings; and (ii) use richer representations of the context. By training on our synthetic examples, correction rates improve by 9{\%} (absolute) compared to the case when models are trained on randomly sampled character perturbations. Using richer contextual representations boosts the correction rate by another 3{\%}. Our toolkit enables practitioners to use our proposed and existing spelling correction systems, both via a simple unified command line, as well as a web interface. Among many potential applications, we demonstrate the utility of our spell-checkers in combating adversarial misspellings. The toolkit can be accessed at neuspell.github.io.",
